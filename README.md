# Solidity-Projects

Goal is to master solidity !! very soon.

Some topics to master > staking, dex, transfer, shitcoin tokenomics, timelocks
LP addition, LP removal, proxy patters, NFTs ERC721, ERC1155, normal ERC20, IUniswapRouter,
contract abis and calling the code, flash loans etc.

### General workflow
Code the contract
Write tests
push it !!!

maybe if there is a frontend, can do it later too
but the former 2 are most important
